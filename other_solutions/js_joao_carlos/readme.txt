Hi,

Here's my solution: https://jcxplorer.github.io/wunderpahkina-vol5/

It's a JavaScript solution which leverages the Canvas APIs to read the image and draw the solution.

To keep it simple, I didn't add Babel or any other JavaScript compiler, so make sure you check it on a recent Browser.

Happy new year!
